# Big-data-mining-for-Aging-population
This is a Scientific research project in the Population and development research institute, School Of Public Affairs, ZheJiang University, Hangzhou 

The Research Advisor is **Prof. Hong Mi**

* The main idea
  * Collecting the data of healthy and unhealthy population in all provinces of China through the
    sixth census. Especially the population of older.
  * Analyze the data we collected using Matlab after we disposal data. The process of disposaling
    data is mainly aimed at deal with the data missed in the report of census
  * Design the model of mathematics including the method of k-means to compute the transfer
    probability between the healthy and unhealthy older people
  * **In a word, this model is basd on the assume of Markov property and Probability transfer. In the process of clusteringï¼Œ we use the PCA to do the work of data preprocessing at first(The main idea is dimension reduction). Then use the method of machine learning such as k-means and Hierarchical clustering**

**This work has received a computer software patent**
